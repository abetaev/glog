intentions
==========

the intentions are generally to express yourself, to release thoughts
into the world. the problem here is to deliver these thoughts without
(or at least with minimal) distortions to whoever is going to perceive.

the only solution known is to define formal standards to:
  * eliminate as much ambiguities in output as possible
  * give reasonable toolkit to rely on to explain remaining ambiguities

i won't.


the toolkit
===========

1. small things matter no less than large ones.
   *minimalism* is the first instrument.

2. having something explained by well-known example may significantly
   increase data absorption process. *example* is the second one.

3. read between the lines.
   *example*: even using standards it is not possible to completetly
   disambiguate writings (typings?) and keep them interesting.
   this is the fact is truly believe in, otherwise i would not focus
   on that.

4. everything matters.
   *example*: the fact that text will contain intentional ambiguities
   does not allow to classify it as technical, but literary.

5. i don't say 'hi'
   generally


instead if saying 'hi'
======================

there are many ways to write code. i write it in a way i like.
i found the following principles/paradigms useful:

1. `KISS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`_

   in other words -- *minimalism*

2. fail-fast

   *example*: you can choose programming language which fails fast
   (haskell fails faster than java, java fails faster than c, c
   fails faster than assembler), you can write code that fails in
   compile time, in runtime or in production. well... you can't
   actually choose between last two :)

3. fool-proof

   *example*: you cannot plug a device incorrectly -- a plug will
   not fit a socket. the same principle must be applied to every
   subject of an engineering process.

4. duality is necessary

   *example*: truth is born in dispute.
   *example*: if there was only one person in the world, truth would
   make no sense anymore.

i respect `SOLID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID>`_ and generally
use as minimal ruleset for decomposition of a problem.

i format code in a way i like. i do not follow any conventions strictly.
i try to make code to be formatted that way so that it will be easier
perceptable rather than aligned according to dumb rules.

the fact that i never follow conventions strictly, defines my attitude
to code as to a piece of art rather then just utility.

the same principle can be applied to anything else coupled with me or
somebody else. that does not give any right to subject person to
make others to think that way and is considered as *religion violation*.
