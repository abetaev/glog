philosofy of abstract engineering
=================================

patterns are...
---------------

... the most wide-spread and the most intricate abstract entities. metaphor has a pattern of a subject. the good one has. bad ones will have some differencies with subject. one smally discrepancy should be enough to make it bad, like one negative multiplier is enough to make positive value to become negative as well. unfortunately it does not work in the oposite direction as with numbers and math, here it is, the bad metaphor and the wrong pattern.


"but what's good then?" one asks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


the `food` is good i answer. add `shit` to `food` and you will never be able to make it `good` again.

that is `good metaphor for metaphor`. don't ever dare to add a smallest piece'o'shit to your metaphors.

and still this is true with some assumptions which are gently covered with...


... abstraction.
----------------

"lets decouple food and shit, and food will become good back again" one says
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eat it then, shit eater.

abstraction has many designations, but there are just few patterns of its application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

abstraction is a tool which helps us to find common patterns in orthogonally different things.

abstraction is a tool which makes us capable to cope with infinite complexity of the nearest vicinity.

"but that makes abstraction indirectly recursive with patterns which are abstract themeselves!"
